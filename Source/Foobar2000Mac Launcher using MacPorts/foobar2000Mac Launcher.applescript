## ignoreError update by BoctorPoo
# Purpose: Launch the MS Windows music program Foobar2000 under Wine 
# Released under GPL 3

# For this to work it requires the following:
#  0) X11 must be installed, if it is not, go grab it from apple's website
#	 or here: http://apple-x11.en.softonic.com
#  1) MacPorts must be installed -> macports.org  
#  2) install wine. in a terminal use this command: 
#	sudo port install wine
#  3) Run wine to launch the Foobar2000 installer you grabbed from foobar2000.org. 
#	In the terminal: 
#	wine ./foobarinstaller.exe
#  4) finally, load this file into AppleScript Editor, compile, and save it as a runable binary.
